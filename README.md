# ATT-Quest-Manager
CJ's ATT Quest Manager -  an application to help users with working with prefabs, along with other functionality.

This is still the early days, so more in-depth guides and new functionality are on their way.

To use, download the .zip, extract, enter your account name, password and server ID into Login.txt.
Make sure someone is on your server when you try to connect, otherwise the connection will fail and the application will close.

Any requests or bug reports? DM  CJ (Siege)#8147  on Discord. Please be patient.

This was inspired by The Prefabulator by Twidge - a vastly superior tool that works for ATT PC servers.
