# ATT-Quest-Manager
The early version of a tool for Quest ATT servers.

To use, enter your account name, password and server ID into Login.txt.
Make sure someone is on your server when you try to connect, otherwise the connect will fail and the application will close.

Any requests or bug reports? DM  CJ (Siege)#8147  on Discord.

This was inspired by The Prefabulator by Twidge - a vastly superior tool that works for ATT PC servers.

As this is the early days it's very barebones, but I hope to add functionality and pretty it up over time.
